/**
 * An alternative to cancellable promises. Allows set()-ing a single promise,
 * discarding the results of any previous ones, regardless whether they
 * resolve or reject.
 *
 * The problem it solves:
 *
 * 1. User interacts with UI
 * 2. Request sent to fetch required data: `getViewData().then((data) => updateView(data))`
 * 3. But now what if the user navigates away? When the promise completes, it will
 *    update the view regardless.
 *
 * In order to solve this, we use `switcher = PromiseSwitcher({ onResolve: updateView })`
 * And then send off requests with `switcher.set(getViewData())`
 * If set() is called with a new Promise while the previous is still pending, the
 * pending promise is ignored â€“ it doesn't call `onResolve` or `onReject`.
